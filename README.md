## 📌 Project 2: Analysis of Voice Masking Algorithms  
**Role:** Researcher & Author  
**Type:** Master's Thesis – Warsaw University (2023)  
**Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Librosa, Matplotlib, FFmpeg, Jupyter Notebook

**Description:**  
This research focuses on improving **Voice Conversion (VC)** systems by integrating **attention mechanisms** into **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based models**. The work explores how attention-based architectures can eliminate the need for feature alignment, enhance the naturalness of converted speech, and reduce computational complexity. It compares state-of-the-art VC techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

**Key Features & Contributions:**  
- 🧠 Proposed an **attention-augmented VAE** model for voice conversion  
- 📊 Evaluated performance using **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**, **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**, and **Mel-Cepstral Distortion**  
- ⚡ Reduced **feature alignment overhead** with attention-based sequence modeling  
- 🎙 Designed experiments with **LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based encoders**  
- 📈 Delivered performance improvements over classical VC approaches  
- 🔍 Comprehensive **analysis of GMM, GAN, Autoencoders, and Transformer architectures**

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- Over-smoothing and robotic-sounding speech in classical VC models  
- High training data requirements and poor generalization to unseen voices  
- Computational inefficiency in feature alignment  

**Impact:**  
- Advanced **privacy-preserving voice masking** techniques  
- Demonstrated improved speech quality and intelligibility  
- Provided insights for next-gen **deep learning VC systems**

- 🔔 **Student Alarm System**: Set and receive notifications for personal or class schedules  
- ⬇️ **Download assignments and materials** from university FTP server  
- 🗂 View previously submitted projects, research, and thesis work  
- 📢 In-app **announcement board** for course or university updates  
- 💾 **Offline local schedule storage** using SQLite  
- 👨‍🏫 Teachers can upload documents to a shared FTP server, accessible by students

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- Students enrolling in courses without meeting prerequisites  
- Lack of access to academic materials and e-books  
- Repetition of final projects and lack of originality in research  
- Inefficient communication between students and academic staff

**Limitations:**  
- Requires Wi-Fi connection for material downloads  
- Assignment submission through the app not supported

**Impact:**  
- Reduced academic friction and miscommunication  
- Encouraged digital literacy and self-management among students  
- Enhanced transparency in academic workflows
